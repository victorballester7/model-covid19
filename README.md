# Modelization of the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Catalonia

In this report we study how many people has to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity from COVID-19 in Catalonia. To do this, we use a variation of the SIRD model in discrete time. Finally, we compare the real data with a prediction of the infected cases if the face masks were not mandatory.
